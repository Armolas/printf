printf is a function in the C programming language used to print formatted output to the console or a file. It takes a string as its first argument, which contains placeholders for values to be inserted into the string. These placeholders are indicated by a % character followed by a letter that indicates the type of value to be inserted. For example, %d is used for integers and %s is used for strings. The remaining arguments to printf provide the values to be inserted into the placeholders in the string.
